# Hello, I'm Mahmoud Alkwisem! 👋

## About Me
I'm a software engineering student at the University of Windsor with a keen interest in frontend development, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML). When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me watching sports, running, or enjoying a long drive.

## My Interests
- 🌌 **Astronomy & Java**: Java is my favorite programming language. I've channeled my passion for astronomy and coding into building a replica of the solar system using Java3D.
- 🏃 **Running**: Whether it's a sprint or a marathon, running is my go-to activity for clearing my mind and staying fit.
- 🚗 **Driving**: There's nothing like a long drive to explore new places or just relax and listen to music.

## Projects
One of my notable projects is a **Replica of the Solar System** built using Java3D. This project allowed me to combine my love for astronomy with my programming skills, creating an interactive 3D model of our solar system.
